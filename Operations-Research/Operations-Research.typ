#definition[Network][
  A network is described as $G=(N, L)$, where $N$ is the set of nodes and $L subset.eq N times N$ is the set of directed arcs/links.
  $ L = {(i, j) in N times N | "there is a directed arc from node i to j"} $
]
Consider $N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$ and $L = {(1,2), (1,3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3,5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4)}$,

  (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3)
)

#definition[Directed Link][
  A link is said to be directed if it allows positive flow in one direction and zero flow in the other direction. E.g. $3 arrow 5$.
]
#definition[Undirected Link][
  A link is said to be directed if it allows flow in both directions. E.g. $4 arrow 5$.
]
#definition[Directed Network][
  A network is said to be directed if all its links are directed.
]
#definition[Undirected Network][
  A network is said to be undirected if it contains a mixture of directed and undirected links.
]
The above example is an undirected network.
#definition[Path][
  A path is a sequence of distinct links that join any two nodes through some other nodes. E.g. $1 arrow 2 arrow 3$.
]
#definition[Directed Path][
  A directed path from node $i$ to node $j$ is a sequence of connected links having flow towards $j$. E.g. $1 arrow 2 arrow 3$.
]
#definition[Undirected Path][
  An undirected path may allow flow in either direction. E.g. $3 arrow 1 arrow 4$.
]
#definition[Cycle][
  A path is said to be a cycle if it connects a node to itself through some other nodes.
]
A directed cycle is $4 arrow 5 arrow 4$. An undirected cycle is $1 arrow 3 arrow 5 arrow 4 arrow 1$.
#definition[Connected Network][
  A network where every pair of distinct nodes is connected by at least one path.
]
#definition[Tree][
  A tree is a connected network that may involve only a subset of all the nodes of the network without having any cycle in between.
]
If a tree has $n$ nodes, then it will have $n-1$ links.
#definition[Spanning Tree][
  A tree that links all the nodes of a network.
]
#definition[Minimum Spanning Tree][
  A tree with the minimum possible total edge weights.
]
#definition[Link Capacity][
  It is the maximum amount of flow that can pass through a directed link. The link capacity function is 
  $ u: L arrow bb(R)_(>= 0) $
]

#algorithm[Prim's Algorithm][
  + Start with any node and connect with the closest distinct node. Tick all the connected nodes
  + Identify the unconnected node that is closest to the ticked nodes and connect
  + Repeat step 1 and 2
]

#algorithm[Kruskal's Algorithm][
  + Sort all edges in ascending order of weights
  + Take the smallest edge not yet taken and add it to the tree if it does not create a cycle
  + Repeat step 2
]

#algorithm[Dijkstra's Algorithm][
  It is a fundamental algorithm to find the *shortest path* from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted directed graph with non-negative edge weights.
  + Assign distance 0 to the source node, ∞ to all others; mark all nodes unvisited
  + While unvisited nodes remain:
    + Pick the unvisited node with the smallest distance
    + For each neighbor, update its distance if a shorter path is found via the current node
    + Mark the current node as visited (its shortest path is finalized)

  Now, to find the path, we retrace the path we took to get to the shortest distance, i.e., we got 12 after finalising node 5, and so on, thus getting the path,
  $ 1 arrow 2 arrow 5 arrow 7 $

#definition[Source Node][
  It is the node where the flow originates. It only has outward edges.
]
#definition[Sink Node][
  It is the node where the flow ends. It only has inward edges.
]
#definition[Bottleneck Capacity][
  It is the minimum capacity of any edge in a path.
]
#definition[Residual Capacity][
  Every edge of a residual network has a value called residual capacity which is equal to the difference between the original flow capacity and the current flow.
]
#definition[Residual Network][
  It is the network obtained after some residuals have been assigned to the links.
]
#definition[Augmenting Path][
  It is a path from the source to the sink in a residual graph along which additional flow can be pushed.
